# Tutorials

These tutorials will walk the user from a basic getting-started guide through designing a full system for use with F´. This will help new users to learn F´ and walk through the most basic steps in developing an F´ application.

-   <span class="card-title">__Hello World__</span>

    ---

    The Hello World tutorial walks new users through creating a new project, designing their first F´ component, and testing that component through an F´ deployment.

-   <span class="card-title">__LED Blinker__</span>

    ---

    LED Blinker walks users through developing an F´ project intended for running on embedded hardware. It covers manager components, hardware drivers, and cross-compilation with the goal of blinking an LED on ARM hardware. Events, Telemetry, Commands, and Parameters are covered as well.

    !!! note
        This tutorial can be run without hardware with the exception of section 6 “Running on Hardware”.

-   <span class="card-title">__Math Component__</span>

    ---

    The Math Component tutorial walks users through constructing a full F´ application including custom Ports, and Enumeration data types. Events, Telemetry, Commands, and Parameters are covered as well. Unit-Testing is also covered.

-   <span class="card-title">__Cross-Compilation Setup Tutorial__</span>

    ---

    Learn how to install all the dependencies required for cross-compiling for different architectures.

-   <span class="card-title">__Arduino LED Blinker__</span>

    ---

    This project is an implementation of the [F´ LED Blinker ARM Linux Tutorial](#) which will allow you to test on Arduino-based microcontrollers using the `fprime-arduino` [toolchain](#) instead of `fprime-arm-linux`.
