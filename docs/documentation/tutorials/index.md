-   <span class="card-title">__Hello World__</span>

    ---

    The Hello World tutorial walks new users through creating a new project, designing their first F´ component, and testing that component through an F´ deployment.

-   <span class="card-title">__LED Blinker__</span>

    ---

    LED Blinker walks users through developing an F´ project intended for running on embedded hardware. It covers manager components, hardware drivers, and cross-compilation with the goal of blinking an LED on ARM hardware. Events, Telemetry, Commands, and Parameters are covered as well.

    !!! note
        This tutorial can be run without hardware with the exception of section 6 “Running on Hardware”.
